### What is this?

I needed a KML file of all the FBO's that accept a Phillips 66 Aviation Credit Card for the $1/gal Angel Flight/Compassion Flight rebate. This KML file can be imported into ForeFlight to make it easy to plan for fuel stops.

The fine people at Phillips Aviation never replied to my emails, so... I decided to just pull the data from their website.

This Python 3.x script requires you to install **requests** and **simplekml** packages.
